\begin{abstract}

The path to success in this class is to do many problems. Unlike other courses, exclusively doing reading(s) will not help. Coming to lecture is akin to watching workout videos; thinking about and solving problems on your own is the actual ``working out''.  Feel free to \qu{work out} with others; \textbf{I want you to work on this in groups.}

Reading is still \textit{required}. For this homework set, read the section about sample spaces in Chapter 2 and relevant parts of Chapter 1 in Ross. Chapter references are from the 7th edition.

The problems below are color coded: \ingreen{green} problems are considered \textit{easy} and marked \qu{[easy]}; \inorange{yellow} problems are considered \textit{intermediate} and marked \qu{[harder]}, \inred{red} problems are considered \textit{difficult} and marked \qu{[difficult]} and \inpurple{purple} problems are extra credit. The \textit{easy} problems are intended to be ``giveaways'' if you went to class. Do as much as you can of the others; I expect you to at least attempt the \textit{difficult} problems.

This homework is worth 100 points but the point distribution will not be determined until after the due date. See syllabus for the policy on late homework.

Up to 15 points are given as a bonus if the homework is typed using \LaTeX. Links to instaling \LaTeX~and program for compiling \LaTeX~is found on the syllabus. You are encouraged to use \url{overleaf.com}. If you are handing in homework this way, read the comments in the code; there are two lines to comment out and you should replace my name with yours and write your section. If you are asked to make drawings, you can take a picture of your handwritten drawing and insert them as figures or leave space using the \qu{$\backslash$vspace} command and draw them in after printing or attach them stapled.

The document is available with spaces for you to write your answers. If not using \LaTeX, print this document and write in your answers. I do not accept homeworks not on this printout. Keep this first page printed for your records. Write your name and section below.

\problem{Assume that the overall probability of contracting breast cancer in a 45 year old American woman is 0.1\% on average (or one in a thousand). A typical diagnostic test is a mammographic scane. Assume also that a mammograph scan reading is 82\% \textit{sensitive} on average and 96\% \textit{specific} on average. Here, \qu{sensitive} means among patients with cancer, the probability that the test is positive and \qu{specific} means among patients without cancer, the probability that the test is negative.}


\begin{enumerate}
\easysubproblem{Denote cancer as $C$ and no cancer as $C^C$ and mammography positive as $T$ and mammography negative as $T^C$. What is $\prob{C}$, $\cprob{T}{C}$ and $\cprob{T^C}{C^C}$? These are readable from the problem statement above. You must use this notation going forward to get full credit.}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Now solve for $\prob{C^C}$, $\cprob{T^C}{C}$ and $\cprob{T}{C^C}$ using the complement rule.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Draw a tree with two branches: $C$ vs. $C^C$ and then draw a second set of branches for $T$ vs. $T^C$ (four branches). Mark all four conditional probabilities in this tree's configuration and all four marginal probabilities on the right. Check your answers by assuring that these four marginal probabilities form a partition of $\prob{\Omega} = 1$.}\spc{9}

\easysubproblem{Draw the \qu{inverted} tree. It has two branches: $T$ vs. $T^C$ and then a second set of branches for $C$ vs. $C^C$ (four branches). Mark all four conditional probabilities in this tree's configuration and all four marginal probabilities on the right. Check your answers by assuring that these four marginal probabilities form a partition of $\prob{\Omega} = 1$.}\spc{9}

\easysubproblem{Draw $\Omega$ as a rectange (that takes up the whole width of the page) with $T$ and $C$ inside. Try to draw to scale.}\spc{4}


\intermediatesubproblem{What is $\prob{T}$? Use the law of total probability here and explain what the law is and how exactly you're using it to solve this problem.}\spc{7}



\hardsubproblem{What does $\prob{T}$ mean? Answer \textit{in English}.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{Now the money question: if a woman is scanned and tests positive, what is the probability she has cancer? Use the notation I have provided and answer as a \textit{percentage} so it is more viscerally interpretable to you. Do not be alarmed if the answer surprises you.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{You may have done the previous question over and over and gotten frustrated. Your answer is probably correct though. Can you explain why it's so low? Comment on the usefulness of mammography given the post test probability of cancer which you computed.}\spc{4}

\easysubproblem{Prove through the rules in class that $\prob{T} = \prob{C,T} + \cprob{T}{C^C}\prob{C^C}$. This is the denominator that is making part (g) so small.}\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{You have shown that $\prob{C,T}$ is trivially small but $\prob{C^C}$ is huge. So what is in actuality driving the low answer in (g)?}\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{If a woman is scanned and tests positive, what is the probability she does \textit{not} have cancer?}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{If a woman is scanned and tests negative, what is the probability she does \textit{not} have cancer?}\spc{5}

\intermediatesubproblem{What is the ratio of $\frac{\cprob{C}{T}}{\cprob{C}{T^C}}$? What does this ratio mean? What does your answer suggest? Is it possible these scans aren't such a terrible diagnostic tool after all? }\spc{8}

%\problem{We will get our feet wet with basic \qu{axioms} and theorems. Assume all capital letters are sets. If the problem asks you to prove a fact, you may only use your knowledge of set theory and the definition of $\prob{\cdot}$ given in the book / lecture.

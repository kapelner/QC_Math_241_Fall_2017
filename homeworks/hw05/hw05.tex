\begin{abstract}
The path to success in this class is to do many problems. Unlike other courses, exclusively doing reading(s) will not help. Coming to lecture is akin to watching workout videos; thinking about and solving problems on your own is the actual ``working out''.  Feel free to \qu{work out} with others; \textbf{I want you to work on this in groups.}

Reading is still \textit{required}. For this homework set, read the section about discrete random variables especially the Bernoulli, the Binomial and the Geometric.

The problems below are color coded: \ingreen{green} problems are considered \textit{easy} and marked \qu{[easy]}; \inorange{yellow} problems are considered \textit{intermediate} and marked \qu{[harder]}, \inred{red} problems are considered \textit{difficult} and marked \qu{[difficult]} and \inpurple{purple} problems are extra credit. The \textit{easy} problems are intended to be ``giveaways'' if you went to class. Do as much as you can of the others; I expect you to at least attempt the \textit{difficult} problems.

This homework is worth 100 points but the point distribution will not be determined until after the due date. See syllabus for the policy on late homework.

Up to 15 points are given as a bonus if the homework is typed using \LaTeX. Links to instaling \LaTeX~and program for compiling \LaTeX~is found on the syllabus. You are encouraged to use \url{overleaf.com}. If you are handing in homework this way, upload \texttt{hwxx.tex} and \texttt{preamble.tex}, read the comments in the code; there are two lines to comment out and you should replace my name with yours and write your section. If you are asked to make drawings, you can take a picture of your handwritten drawing and insert them as figures or leave space using the \qu{$\backslash$vspace} command and draw them in after printing or attach them stapled.

The document is available with spaces for you to write your answers. If not using \LaTeX, print this document and write in your answers. I do not accept homeworks not on this printout. Keep this first page printed for your records. Write your name and section below (A, B or C).

\problem{Imagine you are flipping the same bundle of coins from the practice midterm. The probability of the coin bundle landing on its side is $\prob{S} = 1/11$. Heads and tail probability are 5/11. Let's call landing on its side a \qu{success.}}

\easysubproblem{I flip the coin bundle once. Model a success as a \qu{1.} Show that the r.v. modeling this event outcome is Bernoulli and define its parameter.  Write \qu{$X \sim$} something below. }\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Let's say we flip 10 times. What is the probability that we get one (and only one) success? I want to see a probability model.  Write \qu{$X \sim$} something below. Then I want to see a probability statement. Then I want to see a computation. Answer then in decimal rounded to two digits.  }\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Let's say we flip 10 times. What is the probability that we get 8 (and only 8) successes? }\spc{3}

\problem{Now that we understand both the binomial and the concept of $\iid$, we will ask some conceptual questions.}

\begin{enumerate}


\intermediatesubproblem{ The human mouth has 32 teeth. If the probability of a cavity at some point in a lifetime is 5\%, is it possible to calculate the probability of 7 cavities during a lifetime using a binomial r.v. model $X \sim \binomial{32}{5\%}$ and computing $\prob{X=7}$? Why or why not?  }\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{Bob drives his car twice a day during the workweek, 50 weeks per year for a total of 200 work days and thus, 400 commuting rides. If the probability of getting into an accident is about 1/1000, could we say the number of accidents per year can be modeled as a r.v. $X \sim \binomial{400}{1/1000}$? Why or why not?}\spc{6}

\problem{We will be investigating r.v.'s by imagining a trip the grocery store to buy ingredients for guacamole.

\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{You buy \textit{one} avocado at the grocery store which is good (c.f. a bad avocado which may have brown inside because it's partially rotten). Call this probability of good $p$. Model the number of \textit{good} avocados you have using a random variable. All you need to write is $X \sim$ something. You do not need to write the PMF, draw the PMF, draw the CDF, etc. }\spc{0.5}


\hardsubproblem{You take one avocado, cut it open and see if it's rotten. You keep doing this until you see a \textit{rotten} avocado. Model the number of avocados you cut open using a r.v. Call this r.v. $X$. Be careful between \qu{rotten} and \qu{good}.}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Write the support for the r.v. you created in (b).  }\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{What is the probability you stop when looking at the third avocado?  }\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Use the sigma notation for summing (e.g. $\sum_{i=1}^5$) to calculate the probability that you stop between 4 and 37 avocados (including 4 and including 37). Since you don't know $p$ you cannot actually compute a numerical value for this probability. Leave it in sigma notation.  }\spc{1}


\intermediatesubproblem{Let's say at some point in your avocado shopping that you learned how to detect rotten avocadoes by using the \qu{squeeze test} and you used this learning to select new avocados. What assumption(s) would be violated?  }\spc{2}

\intermediatesubproblem{Grocery stores usually put the old avocados on the top of the avocado basked and thus the new avocados on the bottom. If your strategy was just to pick the \qu{top} avocado each time, what assumption(s) would be violated?}\spc{2}

\problem{We are going to return to our in-class discussion of the my ride from QC to Forest Hills using the Uber Taxi service. Since Queens is in New York City, I will be modeling based on Uber NYC rates. Some numbers have changed from our in-class discussion.

\noindent For the purposes of this exercise, assume there are only two routes in which to drive back. This is close to realistic. There is the \qu{Van Wyck} (outlined in black on the right below) and \qu{Jewel Ave} which is the Q64 bus route (outlined in black on the left below).

The probability of traffic on the Van Wyck is 30\%. The Jewel Ave route is 2.3 miles and takes 13 min and the Van Wyck route is 8 min and is 3.6 miles.}

\begin{enumerate}
\easysubproblem{Let $W$ be the r.v. which models the time I travel in the Uber Taxi. What is its distribution? Use the notation we used in class.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Compute $\expe{D}$.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{UberX charges \$0.35\textbackslash min. Let $M$ be the r.v. which is what I pay for time on my trip home. Find the distribution of $M$.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Write $M$ as a function of $W$.}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Calculate $\expe{M}$ based on the formula we learned in class about expectations of r.v.'s scaled by a constant.}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{UberX charges \$1.75\textbackslash mi of distance covered. Let $L$ be the r.v. which is what I pay for mileage on my trip home. Find the distribution of $L$.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Uber also includes a base fare of \$2.55. Let $B$ be the r.v. which models the total bill for my uberX ride. Write $B$ as a function of $W$ and $D$.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{We didn't really cover this in class, but you should be able to do it. $W$ and $D$ are one-to-one so the scaled $W$ and scaled $D$ sum is really one r.v. Find $\expe{B}$ based also on the formula we learned in class about the expectation of a r.v. with a constant added. }\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Write a sentence that synthesizes what part (p) means.}\spc{1}

\problem{Imagine rolling two fair dice (no sorcery). Let $X_1$ be the r.v. corresponding to the first die and let $X_2$ be the r.v. corresponding to the second die. Let the outcome results be \$1 if you roll a 1, \$2 if you roll a 2, \ldots, and \$6 if you roll a six.

\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{What brand name r.v. is $X_1$ distributed as? Write $X \sim$ something and make sure the parameters are correct. }\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Does $X_1 \equalsindist X_2$? Yes or no is fine.}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Are $X_1$ and $X_2$ independent? Yes or no is fine.}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Compute $\expe{X_1}$ from first principles.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Compute $\var{X_2}$ from first principles.}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{The standard deviation is also called \qu{standard error} and it sometimes denoted \qu{SE.} Use your answer in (e) to find $\se{X_i}$  for $i \in \braces{1,2}$. Please just use the square root and do not rederive the variance again from scratch. }\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Draw the PMF for $X_i$  for $i \in \braces{1,2}$ and mark $\expe{X_i}$ and $\se{X_i}$ on the graph similar to how we did in class.}\spc{6}

\easysubproblem{Imagine the game where you just double the winnings of a single roll. This would be equivalent to just multiplying the r.v. by a scale factor of 2. Calculate $\expe{2X_i}$, $\var{2X_i}$ and $\se{2X_i}$ from the formulas we learned in class. }\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Draw the PMF for $2X_i$ for $i \in \braces{1,2}$ and mark $\expe{2X_i}$ and $\se{2X_i}$ that you calculated in (h) on the graph. }\spc{6}

\hardsubproblem{Draw the PMF for $X_1 + X_2$. This involves taking a convolution. Since convolution won't be on the midterm or final, I'm going to give a hint. There is 1 way to get 2 or 12, 2 ways to get 3 or 11, 3 ways to get 4 or 10, 4 ways to get 5 or 9, 5 ways to get 6 or 8 and 6 ways to get 7. }\spc{7}

\easysubproblem{Calculate $\expe{X_1 + X_2}$, $\var{X_1 + X_2}$ and $\se{X_1 + X_2}$ from the formulas we learned in class. Do not use the PMF from the last question; use the formulas from class.}\spc{2}

\hardsubproblem{Why are the standard errors in (h) and (k) different and why is (h) larger? This involves a lot of thinking and I want a few sentences \textit{in English}. }\spc{8}

\easysubproblem{Imagine the general case of $X_1, \ldots, X_n \iid$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigsq$. Define $\Xbar$ as we did in class. Redo the derivation of $\expe{\Xbar} = \mu$.  }\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Imagine the general case of $X_1, \ldots, X_n \iid$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigsq$. Define $\Xbar$ as we did in class. Redo the derivation of $\se{\Xbar} = \sigma / \sqrt{n}$.  }\spc{3}


\hardsubproblem{Now you have the choice between game A --- where you roll $n$ times and average the winnings (\ie you collect $\Xbar_n$ dollars at the end) or game B --- where you roll one die and collect the amount you make on just one roll. Use your answers to the relevant previous questions (I won't tell you which ones explicitly) to explain why you would choose game A over B or vice versa. I want multiple sentences \textit{in English}. You must convince me you understand the tradeoff that game A and B are making.}\spc{5}


\intermediatesubproblem{Let $Z$ be the standardized r.v. for $\Xbar_n$. Standardization of a r.v. X is defined as subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard error. For $\Xbar$ this would be:

\beqn
Z := \frac{\Xbar - \expe{\Xbar}}{\se{\Xbar}} =\frac{\Xbar - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}  
\eeqn

Prove from the formulas in class that $\expe{Z} = 0$ and $\var{Z} = \se{Z} = 1$. Hint: use those two rules about $\var{aX}$ and $\var{X + c}$ you just rederived}\spc{5}

\easysubproblem{Why is do you think \qu{standardization} is an appropriate term for what we did above?}\spc{2}


\intermediatesubproblem{Returning to $X$, the dice game in the beginning of the problem (the outcome results being \$1 if you roll a 1, \$2 if you roll a 2, \ldots, and \$6 if you roll a six), you calculated variance using the definition $\var{X} := \expe{\squared{X-\mu}}$ assuming the classic squared error loss: $e(x,\mu) := \squared{x - \mu}$. Imagine we defined a new variance metric using absolute loss, $e(x,\mu) := \abss{x - \mu}$. We'll denote this \qu{new variance} with a big squiggly symbol, $\widetilde{\var{X}} := \expe{\abss{X - \mu}}$ just to make sure you don't confuse it with the standard definition of $\var{X}$. Calculate $\widetilde{\var{X}}$ and include units.}\spc{10}

\extracreditsubproblem{Imagine a r.v. $X$ with PMF $p(x) = c/x^2$ and $\support{X} = \naturals$. What is the exact value of $c$ which makes $p(x)$ a valid PMF? The answer can be found \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function}{here}. }\spc{3}

\extracreditsubproblem{$X$ is the same as in the previous problem. Show that $\var{X}$ does not exist (which means it's not a real number). You will need a fact from that same wikipedia page that you visited in the last problem. And now you've learned what the harmonic series is too. }\spc{10}

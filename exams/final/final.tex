\problem You are the marketing executive for a food company that is developing a new granola bar. You are so busy worrying about sales and distribution that you cannot work too hard on flavor, hence you pick the most loved flavor: chocolate. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{chocolate.png}
\end{center}

\noindent You want to indeed verify this will sell so you do a survey as follows: each person in the survey tastes the bar and tells you whether or not they would buy it from you. Call the true proportion of people who would buy it $p$.

\problem You are composing jazz music for the piano (example below).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{jazz.png}
\end{center}

\noindent The typical \qu{American songbook} style music is four-bar in the form AABA where each bar is four measures. There is typically one chord per measure. Thus there are 8 unique measures in a single song and hence 8 chords. 

To pick a chord, you first pick a key and then a quality. There are 12 keys to choose from: $C, C\sharp, D, D\sharp, E, F, F\sharp, G, G\sharp, A, A\sharp, B$ and 8 chord qualities: major, minor, augmented, half diminished, full diminished, dominant 7th, minor 7th and major 7th.

Pretend all chords are picked at random for the purpose of this question and that all 8 chords are unique.


\benum
\subquestionwithpoints{3} How many unique chords are there? You need one key and one quality. Compute explicitly. \spc{4}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} How many ways are there to choose 8 unique chords where order doesn't matter? No need to compute explicitly. \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} How many ways are there to choose 8 unique chords where order \emph{does} matter? No need to compute explicitly. \spc{3}

\problem Below are some theoretical questions.

\benum
\subquestionwithpoints{4} Let $X \sim \poisson{\lambda} = \lambda^x e^{-\lambda} / x!$. The mgf of $X$ is $M_X(t) = e^{\lambda (e^t - 1)}$ and $\support{X} = \naturals_0$ i.e. all natural numbers including zero. Provide an expression for $\expe{X}$ using the definition of expectation for discrete r.v.'s but do not solve. \spc{4}


\subquestionwithpoints{5} Let $X \sim \poisson{\lambda} = \lambda^x e^{-\lambda} / x!$.

\problem You are the biostatician for a drug company that is trying to develop a drug to treat skin cancer which has spread to lymph nodes (we will call this the \qu{disease}). There are no drugs currently available for the disease so the company is developing a drug and wants to run a trial in the future.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{pills.png}
\end{center}

\noindent The recovery rate right now for patients with the disease is 63\%. Assume this is the truth known with certainty.

\benum
\subquestionwithpoints{2} Bob who has the disease wants to be part of the drug trial. Model Bob's recovery as of now as 1 if he recovers and 0 if he does not recover as a r.v. below. Be sure to indicate parameter value(s). \spc{1} 

\subquestionwithpoints{3} 100 people just like Bob with the disease want to be part of the trial. Model the total number of people of those 100 who will recover as of now below as the r.v. $X$. Be sure to indicate parameter value(s). \spc{1} 

\subquestionwithpoints{4} What two assumptions did you make about the 100 people in order to build the model in part (b)? Explain each in this context. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Assumption Name: \hspace{2.0in} & Assumption Name: \hspace{2.0in} \\ \hline
Discussion: & Discussion: \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Calculate the expected number of people of the 100 who will recover.  \spc{1} 

\subquestionwithpoints{3} Compute explicitly the percentage that exactly 63 people will recover. Round to two decimal places. \spc{3} 

%\subquestionwithpoints{3} Why is your answer to (f) so low? Discuss. \spc{3} 

\subquestionwithpoints{5} For those 100 people just like Bob with the disease, model the \textit{proportion} of people who will recover below as the r.v. $\Phat$ and provide its \textit{approximate} distribution. Be sure to indicate parameter values.\spc{5}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} What theorem did you use to answer (h)? No need to discuss. \spc{1} 

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Find $\prob{\Phat = 0.63}$ below assuming the approximate distribution (and not the distribution of the r.v. in part b). \spc{0.1} 

\subquestionwithpoints{2} We will now start testing our drug. Denote the proportion of people who truly recover as the population parameter $p$. We are unsure if the drug works and want to be scientifically honest. Thus our null hypothesis will be that the proportion of people who recover when taking the drug will be \textit{at most} the same as the population overall. Write this in our notation we used in class below. \spc{1}


\subquestionwithpoints{2} Write the alternative hypothesis using the notation we learned in class. \spc{0.1}

\subquestionwithpoints{1} What is the official name of this statistical test? \spc{1}


\subquestionwithpoints{2} We will set $\alpha = 2.5\%$ since the scientific community is very conservative when it comes to new drugs. What is the probability of a Type I error?\spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} Explain what a Type I error would be in this context.\spc{1}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} Explain what a Type II error would be in this context.\spc{1}

\subquestionwithpoints{3} Discuss what you believe the cost of a type II error would be in this case. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} For the case where we have $n=100$ people who take the drug, find the retainment region for $H_0$ in this hypothesis test. Round to three digits. \spc{8}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Imagine 72 people of the 100 in the drug trial recovered. Run the hypothesis test, state the conclusion and then write a sentence which explains your conclusion in the context of drug trial. \spc{4}


\subquestionwithpoints{1} Regardless of the conclusion of the hypothesis test, you \emph{feel} deep down inside that the drug is effective in increasing the recovery rate of the disease. What type of error do you \emph{feel} you made here? No explanation necessary. \spc{1}


\subquestionwithpoints{3} If you were to design another experiment to prove that the drug is effective, what would you do differently and why? Hint: increasing $\alpha$ is \textit{not} the answer. \spc{3}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Regardless of the conclusion of the hypothesis test, we will pretend that the point estimate you computed, i.e. $\phat = 0.72$, represents the real probability of recovery under the drug. Denote $R$ as the event of recovery and $D$ as the event that the drug was taken. Thus $R^C$ denotes the person did not recover and $D^C$ denotes the person did not take the drug. What is $\cprob{R}{D}$? \spc{1}

\subquestionwithpoints{1} Find $\cprob{R^C}{D}$.\spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{6} Let's say the drug is on the market and you estimate 20\% of the people who have the disease take the drug. You see someone who recovers, what is the probability they took the drug? \spc{7}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{call.png}

\noindent You have millions of clients but the probability each of them call in at any moment is very small. If there are 3,000,0000 clients and the probability any of them call in any second is 1 in 1,000,000 then you can say $\lambda = 3$ and model time in seconds until the next call as an \emph{exponential} distribution.

\benum
\subquestionwithpoints{2} Based on the description above, denote the time until the next call as r.v. $X$. Notate its distribution below as $X \sim$ something.\spc{5}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Provide a rough illustration of $f(x)$. Label the axes and label one point on the y-axis that is not 0. Do not worry about scale. \spc{6}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Provide a rough illustration of $F(x)$. Label the axes and label one point on the y-axis that is not 0. Do not worry about scale.  \spc{5}


\subquestionwithpoints{4} What is the probability we will wait more than 5 seconds for the next call that comes in? No need to compute explicitly. \spc{3}

The traveling time of each stop can be modeled as a r.v. with distribution $\normnot{1}{0.2042^2}$ minutes and we will assume independent travel time for each stop.

Below is the number of events in each month in 2014 and represents the number of \qu{UFO sightings} across America, a country with 319 million people. Assume that each sighting is unique --- that is each person either makes a sighting for a given or does not and there are no duplicates. That is, a person cannot make more than one sighting per 12-month period.
